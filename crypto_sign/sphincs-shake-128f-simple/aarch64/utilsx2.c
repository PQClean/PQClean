/*
 * Generate the entire Merkle tree, computing the authentication path for leaf_idx,
 * and the resulting root node using Merkle's TreeHash algorithm.
 * Expects the layer and tree parts of the tree_addr to be set, as well as the
 * tree type (i.e. SPX_ADDR_TYPE_HASHTREE or SPX_ADDR_TYPE_FORSTREE)
 *
 * This expects tree_addrx2 to be initialized to 2 parallel addr structures for
 * the Merkle tree nodes
 *
 * Applies the offset idx_offset to indices before building addresses, so that
 * it is possible to continue counting indices across trees.
 *
 * This works by using the standard Merkle tree building algorithm, except
 * that each 'node' tracked is actually 2 consecutive nodes in the real tree.
 * When we combine two logical nodes AB and WX, we perform the H
 * operation on adjacent real nodes, forming the parent logical node
 * (AB)(WX)
 *
 * When we get to the top level of the real tree (where there is only
 * one logical node), we continue this operation one more time; the right
 * most real node will by the actual root (and the other node will be
 * garbage).  We follow the same thashx2 logic so that the 'extract
 * authentication path components' part of the loop is still executed (and
 * to simplify the code somewhat)
