 * Falcon API Notes
 * ----------------
 *
 *
 * FALCON DEGREE
 *
 * Falcon is parameterized by a degree, which is a power of two. Formally,
 * two values are possible: 512 and 1024 (for Falcon-512 and Falcon-1024,
 * respectively). This implementation also supports lower degrees, from
 * 2 to 256; these reduced variants do not provide adequate security and
 * should be used for research purposes only.
 *
 * In all functions and macros defined below, the degree is provided
 * logarithmically as the 'logn' parameter: logn ranges from 1 to 10,
 * and represents the degree 2^logn.
 *
 *
 * ERROR REPORTING
 *
 * All functions that may fail for some reason return an 'int' value. A
 * returned value of zero is a success; all error conditions are
 * reported as an error code. Error codes are negative. Macros are
 * defined for some error codes; in the interest of forward
 * compatiblity, applications that use this implementation should be
 * prepared to receive other error codes not listed in the macros below.
 *
 *
 * TEMPORARY BUFFERS
 *
 * Many functions expect temporary areas, provided as the parameter
 * 'tmp'. The caller is responsible for allocating these areas with the
 * proper size; the FALCON_TMPSIZE_* macros evaluate to constant
 * expressions that yield the proper size (in bytes) and can be used to
 * allocate the temporaries on the stack or elsewhere. There are no
 * alignment requirements on temporaries (the functions handle alignment
 * internally).
 *
 * The caller is responsible for clearing temporary buffer contents,
 * if such memory scrubbing is deemed relevant in the context where this
 * implementation is used.
 *
 * The same temporary buffer can be reused for several operations,
 * possibly distinct from each other. For all degrees from 8 to 1024
 * (logn = 3 to 10), the following sizes are in ascending order:
 *
 *    FALCON_TMPSIZE_MAKEPUB
 *    FALCON_TMPSIZE_VERIFY
 *    FALCON_TMPSIZE_KEYGEN
 *    FALCON_TMPSIZE_SIGNTREE
 *    FALCON_TMPSIZE_EXPANDPRIV
 *    FALCON_TMPSIZE_SIGNDYN
 *
 * i.e. a temporary buffer large enough for computing signatures with
 * an expanded key ("SIGNTREE") will also be large enough for a
 * key pair generation ("KEYGEN"). For logn = 1 or 2, the same order
 * holds, except that the KEYGEN buffer is larger.
 *
 * Here are the actual values for the temporary buffer sizes (in bytes):
 *
 * degree  mkpub  verify  keygen  signtree  expkey  signdyn
 *     2      13      17     285       107     111      163
 *     4      25      33     291       207     215      319
 *     8      49      65     303       407     423      631
 *    16      97     129     503       807     839     1255
 *    32     193     257     999      1607    1671     2503
 *    64     385     513    1991      3207    3335     4999
 *   128     769    1025    3975      6407    6663     9991
 *   256    1537    2049    7943     12807   13319    19975
 *   512    3073    4097   15879     25607   26631    39943
 *  1024    6145    8193   31751     51207   53255    79879
 *
 * Take care that the "expkey" column here qualifies the temporary buffer
 * for the key expansion process, but NOT the expanded key itself (which
 * has size FALCON_EXPANDEDKEY_SIZE(logn) and is larger than that).
 *
 *
 * FORMATS
 *
 * Public and private keys are exchanged as serialized sequences of
 * bytes. Their respective sizes are fixed (for a given degree) and the
 * FALCON_PRIVKEY_SIZE and FALCON_PUBKEY_SIZE macros return that value
 * as constant expressions.
 *
 * There are three formats for signatures:
 *
 *   - COMPRESSED: this is the default format, which yields the shortest
 *     signatures on average. However, the size is variable (see below)
 *     though within a limited range.
 *
 *   - PADDED: this is the compressed format, but with extra padding bytes
 *     to obtain a fixed size known at compile-time. The size depends only
 *     on the degree; the FALCON_SIG_PADDED_SIZE macro computes it. The
 *     signature process enforces that size by restarting the process
 *     until an appropriate size is obtained (such restarts are uncommon
 *     enough that the computational overhead is negligible).
 *
 *   - CT: this is a fixed-size format, which furthermore allows
 *     constant-time processing with regard to the signature value and
 *     message data. This is meant for uncommon situations in which
 *     the signed data is secret but of low entropy, and the public key
 *     is not actually public. The CT format is larger than the
 *     COMPRESSED and PADDED formats.
 *
 * The signature format is selected by the 'sig_type' parameter to
 * the signature generation and verification functions.
 *
 * Actual signature size has been measured over 10000 signatures for each
 * degree (100 random keys, 100 signatures per key):
 *
 * degree     ct   padded  compressed (with std. dev)  comp_max
 *     2      44      44       44.00 (+/- 0.00)            44
 *     4      47      47       46.03 (+/- 0.17)            47
 *     8      52      52       50.97 (+/- 0.26)            52
 *    16      65      63       60.45 (+/- 0.52)            64

 *    64     137     122      117.69 (+/- 0.94)           130
 *   128     233     200      193.96 (+/- 1.30)           219
 *   256     425     356      346.53 (+/- 1.84)           397
 *   512     809     666      651.59 (+/- 2.55)           752
 *  1024    1577    1280     1261.06 (+/- 3.57)          1462
 *
 * with:
 *   degree = Falcon degree = 2^logn
 *   ct = FALCON_SIG_CT_SIZE(logn)  (size of a CT signature)
 *   padded = FALCON_SIG_PADDED_SIZE(logn)  (size of a PADDED signature)
 *   compressed = measured average length of a COMPRESSED signature
 *   v_max = FALCON_SIG_COMPRESSED_MAXSIZE(logn)  (maximum theoretical
 *           size of a COMPRESSED signature)
 * All lengths are in bytes.
 *
 * A private key, in its encoded format, can be used as parameter to
 * falcon_sign_dyn(). An "expanded private key" is computed with
 * falcon_expand_privkey(), to be used with falcon_sign_tree(). The
 * expanded private key is much larger than the encoded private key, and
 * its format is not portable. Its size (in bytes) is provided by
 * FALCON_EXPANDEDKEY_SIZE. There are no specific alignment requirements
 * on expanded keys, except that the alignment of a given expanded key
 * must not change (i.e. if an expanded key is moved from address addr1
 * to address addr2, then it must hold that addr1 = addr2 mod 8).
 * Expanded private keys are meant to be used when several signatures are
 * to be computed with the same private key: amortized cost per signature
 * is about halved when using expanded private keys (for short messages,
 * and depending on underlying architecture and implementation choices).
 *
 *
 * USE OF SHAKE256
 *
 * SHAKE256 is used in two places:
 *
 *  - As a PRNG: all functions that require randomness (key pair
 *    generation, signature generation) receive as parameter a SHAKE256
 *    object, in output mode, from which pseudorandom data is obtained.
 *
 *    A SHAKE256 instance, to be used as a RNG, can be initialized
 *    from an explicit 48-byte seed, or from an OS-provided RNG. Using
 *    an explicit seed is meant for reproducibility of test vectors,
 *    or to be used in cases where no OS-provided RNG is available and
 *    supported.
 *
 *  - As the hashing mechanism for the message which should be signed.
 *    The streamed signature API exposes that SHAKE256 object, since
 *    the caller then performs the hashing externally.
 */

/*
 * Error codes.
 *
 * Most functions in this API that may fail for some reason return an
 * 'int' value which will be 0 on success, or a negative error code.
 * The macros below define the error codes. In the interest of forward
 * compatibility, callers should be prepared to receive additional error
 * codes not included in the list below.
